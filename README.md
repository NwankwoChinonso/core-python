# Core_Python

A structured collection of core Python concepts, exercises, and examples covering the fundamentals of the language.  
This repository focuses on building a strong foundation in Python through clear, well-organized code and practical practice.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Refresh and solidify core Python knowledge
- Practice writing clean, readable, and idiomatic Python
- Build a strong base for advanced software development, data science, and machine learning work

It intentionally focuses on **fundamentals only**, without frameworks or domain-specific libraries.

## Topics Covered

The repository covers, but is not limited to:

- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (sequence, conditionals, and loops)
- Functions and modular code
- Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Error and exception handling
- File handling
- Modules and Packages
- Iterators & Generators
- Comprehensions
- Functional Programming Concepts
- Date, Time & OS Interaction
- Debuggig & Testing
- Input / Output & CLI
- Pythonic Pracctices
- Performance & Memory
- Common Standard Library Modules
- Problem-solving patterns

## Progress Philosophy

The goal is **clarity over complexity**:
- Simple, readable code
- Emphasis on understanding fundamentals deeply
- Incremental improvement through practice
